# Hyper Nibbly

This is a simple snake-like game in Vanilla JavaScript + SVG I made while travelling with Deutsche Bahn. 

Try to eat all the cookies. :)

# Running it locally

You can use `npm install` and `npm start` to start a local web server based on node [express](https://expressjs.com).

# Challenges

- make it responsive and playable on mobile.
- sound when the snake eats a cookie?
- smooth animation of the snake tail? (maybe see: https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/)
